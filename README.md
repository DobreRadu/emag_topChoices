# emag_topChoices
Allows you to put in a link to a page from emag and it will give you a list of "Super Pret" and "Top Favorite" items from the category.
You can change the "hrefGlobal" variable to the path you want.I used "/routere_wireless/filter/tip-produs-f8795,sistem-mesh-v-7395518/c?ref=hp_menu_quick-nav_23_40&type=filter" in my apllication.
It also uses MongoDB to connect with an user and also stores the result from the search.I store the passswords and users in SHA256 so they are not in plain text.
The result will also be printed so you can try it out!
